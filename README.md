<b>Steps to implement project:</b>
(1) Connect and external web camera to your desktop/laptop.<br/>
(2) Open main.py file in a Python IDE.<br/>
(3) Write the sender email address & password and reciver email address in main.py file.<br/>
(4) Open terminal in Python IDE and enter the commands "pip install opencv-python" and "pip install flask" individually.<br/>
(5) Run the main.py file and note down the Server IP address and Port number generated<br/>
(5) Construct circuit with ESP8266, sensors and actuators following the circuit diagram & video and connect the NodeMCU 1.0 to the laptop using cable .<br/>
(6) Open Intrusion_Detection.ino in Arduino IDE<br/>
(7) Select the port on which Node MCU 1.0 is connected at the top bar of Arduino IDE.<br/> 
(8) Install CP1202x driver in the port on which NodeMCU 1.0 is connected.<br/>
(9) Write the Wifi SSID, Password, Server IP address and Port number in Intrusion_Detection.ino file.<br/>
(10) Verify & Upload the file in Arduino IDE to run the file and thus, the entire project.<br/>
